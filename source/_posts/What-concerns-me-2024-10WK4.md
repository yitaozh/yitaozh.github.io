## Goal of this doc

People are not productive under anxiety. In daily life, people have concerns about different things: work, life, finance and so on. The goal of this doc:

1. Review the action items from last review and see how it goes.
2. Identify whatâ€™s concerning to me at the moment.
3. (Can I address them and) How to address them?
4. Get the Action Items from it.

The doc should be updated fortnightly. The Friday afternoon is a good time. Calendar already set up for this event.

When writing the new doc, all items from the old doc should be copied, the ones resolved can be marked as resolved or cross-lined, and they will be removed next time. New items should be added to the top lines of each section.

## Retro

- I think the planning works great, I should always have planning for every hour.
- Working on one thing longer than one hour is detrimental to efficiency. So, the planning cannot be more than 1 hour and work and learning should be intervaled.

## My current concerns

### Work

#### Long term

1. My pay is not good, SDE of 4\~5 YOE should have 450\~500K salary

#### High level idea

1. I should change job as soon as possible. The Date For Filling falls back, no meaning in waiting for submitting I-485 any more.

#### Action item

1. I should start the preparation right now.

#### Short term

1. I am not doing impactful projects.
    - Instead of working on new projects, I am working for launches, or dirty work, it's a waste of time and humiliation.
1. The team I am currently is drowning.
    - The EFS service is getting de-prioritized, so working in this team has no future.
1. I am working with ~~a~~ two incompetent bad managers.

#### High level ideas

1. Considering I am going to leave Amazon, i don't care about project, manager or team any more.

#### Action items for Work

- Write a doc about learning from STJE failure.
- [Resolved] ~~Have a planning section in the morning, depending on the meeting schedules:~~
  - ~~If RTO, then have it right after the standup.~~
  - ~~If at home, then have it right after the breakfast.~~
  - ~~The focus is to finish the work before 1 PM, then leave the afternoon for growth(leetcode, course)~~
  - The important thing is to have schedule at hourly granularity
- Clear the study and make the bed usable.

### Life

The life concerns are followed up in the [Things need to followup - Life](Things-need-to-followup-Life.md) doc

1. I didn't spend enough time with Awei.
1. The weekend time is not well spent.
1. The windows are blurred, I need to replace them.

### High level ideas

1. Use weekend day time for learning and evening for entertainment.

### Action items for Life

- After returning from China, i should followup on the window issue, better get it replaced this Autumn/Winter.
- Chat with Awei on the time schedule post returning to the U.S. Ideas:
  - Go out with Awei on Friday afternoon after getting the car.
  - Go out with Awei on one day of the weekend(prefer Saturday).
- Use other weekend day time for learning and evening for entertainment.

    1. [Resolved] ~~Now I am making time for leetcode daily, but the contest problems are taking weekday times.~~
1. I want to prepare the system design.
1. I want to get more impact and income: earn by knowledge.
