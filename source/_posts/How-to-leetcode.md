### The motivation

A good software developer doesn't necessarily need to be a good IOer, but in general a good IOer is more likely to be a good software developer. This logic makes coding more and more important in tech interview.

### The daily routine

In general, at least one hour per day should be dedicated to leecode practice. Current schedule is 5:00 ~ 6:00 P.M.

### The environment

I am currently using vscode leetcode plugin, it has a good integration with top comments and submit.

### The order to solve problems

The [Explore](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/) is a great place to start. Finish all courses then continue to next step.

### The steps to tackle one problem

If not idea at all, just check the comments. No need to wait for 5, 10 minutes

### Advance

Weekly contest, then codeforce
