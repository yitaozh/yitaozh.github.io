[8. String to Integer (atoi)](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/description/?envType=company&envId=facebook&favoriteSlug=facebook-three-months)

## Description

Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

- **Whitespace** : Ignore any leading whitespace (`" "`).
- **Signedness** : Determine the sign by checking if the next character is `'-'` or `'+'`, assuming positivity if neither present.
- **Conversion** : Read the integer by skipping leading zerosuntil a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
- **Rounding** : If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]`, then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-2^31` should be rounded to `-2^31`, and integers greater than `2^31 - 1` should be rounded to `2^31 - 1`.

Return the integer as the final result.

**Example 1:**

```bash
Input: s = "42"

Output: 42

Explanation:

The underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)
           ^
```

**Example 2:**

```bash
Input: s = " -042"

Output: -42

Explanation:

Step 1: "   -042" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2: "   -042" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3: "   -042" ("042" is read in, leading zeros ignored in the result)
               ^
```

**Example 3:**

```bash
Input: s = "1337c0d3"

Output: 1337

Explanation:

Step 1: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "1337c0d3" ("1337" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
```

**Example 4:**

```bash
Input: s = "0-1"

Output: 0

Explanation:

Step 1: "0-1" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "0-1" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "0-1" ("0" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
          ^
```

**Example 5:**

```bash
Input: s = "words and 987"

Output: 0

Explanation:

Reading stops at the first non-digit character 'w'.
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 200`
- `s` consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (`0-9`), `' '`, `'+'`, `'-'`, and `'.'`.

## Solution

Language: **C++**

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int myAtoi(string s) {
        int i = 0, n = s.size();
        while (i < n && s[i] == ' ') {
            i++;
        }
        if (i == n) return 0;
        int sign = 1;
        if (s[i] == '-') {
            sign = -1;
            i++;
        } else if (s[i] == '+') {
            i++;
        }
        long num = 0;
        while (i < n && isdigit(s[i])) {
            int digit = s[i] - '0';
            num = num * 10 + digit;
            if (num * sign > INT_MAX) {
                return INT_MAX;
            }
            if (num * sign < INT_MIN) {
                return INT_MIN;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return num * sign;
    }
};
```
