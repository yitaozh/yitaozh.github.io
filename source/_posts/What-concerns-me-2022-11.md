## Goal of this doc

People are not productive under anxiety. In daily life, people have concerns about different things: work, life, finance and so on. The goal of this doc:

1. Review the action items from last review and see how it goes.
2. Identify what’s concerning to me at the moment.
3. (Can I address them and) How to address them?
4. Get the Action Items from it.

The doc should be updated quarterly. The first Sunday night of each quarter is a good time. Next time: 2023/01/02

When writing the new doc, all items from the old doc should be copied, and marked as still or resolved.

## My current concerns

### Work

#### Long term

1. [Still] My pay is not good, SDE of 2\~3 YOE should have 350\~400K salary
2. [Still] My rating is not good, I got Meets in 2021 rating, how to get exceeds in 2022?

#### Short term

1. [Still] I am not very productive during the day, no matter morning or afternoon, which means I need to work after-hour to meet up the goal.
    - [Still] For the morning, mostly it’s because I can only get up at 9:15 or even 9:30, which means I need some business time for the morning shower and breakfast.
    - [Still] In the afternoon, my at-home-office is too hot to concentrate. The sunshine could make the room boiling from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.
    - [Resolved] ~During business time, I got a lot of distraction from the reach outs: mostly from L4 new hires and L6 managers.~
2. [Still] I have a terrible procrastination for doc writing tasks: I cannot finish a doc writing within 2 weeks.
3. I am going to have a new manager, either it's David or Ravi. David is micro management while i don't know about Ravi.
4. The STJE project is running into all kinds of troubles and we are seeing more assertion/crashes than expected.

### Life:

1. [Resolved] ~I didn’t get enough sleep. I need 6.5 ~ 7 hours of sleep every day, but I cannot get that much sleep every day.~
2. [Still] I didn’t have the time to have all the entertainment every day. I want to:
    - [Still] Watch all the video updates
    - [Still] Watch all the Anime I am following
    - [Still] Have some time to play computer games every day/week
    - [Still] Play Arknights sometimes
3. [Resolved] ~I don’t know if we can go back to ShangHai this time. I have spent too much money and effort on this thing.~
4. The heater goes bad, i need to find someone to repair it.
5. The windows are blurred, i need to replace them.
6. The car. I should buy a car so the life got much easier.
7. The 401K, IRA problem.

### Growth:

1. [Still] I want to work on Leetcode routinely. I want to study CS courses/books.
2. [Still] I want to grow hobbies: piano, guitar and so on
3. [Still] I didn’t follow the Mint Reads very well.
4. [Still] My weight loss project doesn’t go very well, I am sometimes full even in late night.

## How to mitigate the concerns

### Work

#### Long term

1. [Still] My I-140 get approved on 2022-11-02. ~I cannot do anything to my pay right now. Because even I get a new offer, I cannot afford the result that current employer doesn’t compete the offer: My PD day hasn’t been decided. My next steps are:~
    - [Resolved] ~Upon PERM approval, I should ask Fragomen to file the I-140 as soon as possible and ask Srinivas@ to support the PP. I have bookmarked the template for a PP request.~
    - [Resolved] ~Currently, the PERM processing time is 192 day, my PD is Jan 25, 2022. The expectation for the approval date is July 14, 2022. If my I-140 files + approves within 30 days, it would be August 15, 2022. I need to wait until at least Feb 15, 2022 to go to the new company. I should start the job seeking 45 days earlier: It’s Jan 1, 2022 right now.~
    - [Still] I should start the preparation right now.
      - [Still] Currently, reserve at least 1.5 hour for Leetcode every workday (in the work time) and weekends. Also read DDIA / system design books daily.
      - [Resolved] There's no major change comparing to current schedule. ~3 months before the job seeking time (it would be determined according to the I-140 approval time), I need to prepare for the interview intensively: 2 hours workday + 2 hours weekend. System design schedule is unchanged.~
    - [Still] Under what scenarios would I pause/stop the plan?
      - The job seeking market becomes terrible, but I should continue the daily Leetcode plan
      - Should I stop the plan if I got exceeds next year? No, that wouldn’t match my pay to the current level.
2. [Still] I should drive the execution of STJE, the productivity actually depends on the short-term solutions.

#### Short term

1. [Still] 8:30 - 8:45 is a good get-up time.
    - I need 15 minutes for the morning shower
    - I need 15 minutes for the breakfast
    - I need 15 minutes for the morning planning
    - If WFH, I should get up at 8:45, as the latest time
    - If going to the office, I need another 5 (bike time) + (20) MBTA + (15) Shuttle = 40 minutes to go to the office, which means I can barely catch the standup, if getting up at 8:45.
2. [Still] I should replace the windows as soon as possible.
    - [Resolved] ~If Awei and I can return to China this time, then replace the windows soon~
    - [Resolved] We made it to China this June! ~If we cannot make it this June, then replace it at the end of June~
    - [Still] I should check with the property manager on:
        - [Still] Is it allowed to install an awning?
        - [Still] Is it allowed to install awning windows?
3. [Resolved] Summer has passed. ~Before replacing the windows, I should check the temperature every day, and just go out to study in the afternoon, arrange it in the morning planning.~
4. [Resolved] ~I should defer the reach-out if I am concentrating on something, make it a habit.~
5. [Still] How to finish doc writing tasks on time:
    - Break the tasks into smaller pieces
    - Setup a goal: what I must finish within today
    - Setup early reviews with folks: As soon as I take a doc writing task, setup a first review time as 1 week later, and with a few core stakeholder folks
6. For the new manager choice, let's wait until i get the new project.

#### Action items for Work

1. Have a planning section in the morning, depending on the meeting schedules:
    - Must finish items within the day (estimate during planning)
    - Mint reading (30 minutes) (if 16:30 ~ 17:00 is occupied)
    - Leetcode (1 hour) (if 17:00 ~ 18:00 is occupied)
    - [Resolve] This goes to evening ~DDIA (1 hour)~
    - [Resolve] It's not summer ~Planning if I should go out~
2. Follow the schedule and start Leetcode + System design learning ASAP
3. Write a separate doc on how to write design/ORR

### Life

1. [Resolved] ~I should go to sleep at 1:30 - 2:00 on weekday, no later than that.~
2. The time for entertainment:
    - [Resolved] Not a good plan, would use 9:30 ~ 10:00 ~I should try to spend time between 6 and 7 for BaiCiZhan~
    - [Resolved] ~Running time: about one hour, I can watch videos during this time, recommendation: 1.25 Asoul~
    - [Resovled] Awei prefers to watch TV with me earlier. ~After running, shower and construction time, I have 9:00 ~ 11:00 myself~
    - [Resolved] No need ~Awei shower time: about 30 minutes, I can use it for Journal read, GongZhongHao~
    - [Still] Weekends: I can have morning and evening for entertainment
3. For Arknights:
    - [Resolved] I have a automated job runner now. ~If there’s no event, should clear the request in the morning before business time and during evening entertainment time~
    - [Still] If there’s one event ongoing, should check the tips asap and clear the maps
4. [Resolved] ~I have done everything for the ShangHai trip now, the only thing not done is the test appointments. Ideas:~
    - ~6.20 Ayass, no need for appointment~
    - ~6.25 RT for Awei, not sure if RT for Yitao, checking later~
    - ~6.26 Ayass for Awei and Yitao in the morning~
    - ~6.26 RT for Awei and Yitao in the afternoon~
5. Should i save money to buy a car? If I plan to go back to china in May and back in August in 2023.
    - Now i have 14K, assuming without changing the contribution rate i can save 1k per month, when returning to china can save 2k per month.
    ```
    14k + 2(2 months remaining this year) * 1k + 4(Jan - Apr) * 1k + 3(May - July) * 2k - 4k(ticket) + 2k(real estate tax exemption) = 24k
    ```
    - If i change the rate then i can save 4k per month, if i change the rate from Jan to April.
    ```
    14k + 2(2 months remaining this year) * 1k + 4(Jan - Apr) * 4k + 3(May - July) * 2k - 4k(ticket) + 2k(real estate tax exemption) = 36k
    ```

#### Action items for Life

1. Use weekend day time for entertainment and evening for learning
2. When there's an arknight eveent, use the entertainment time to tend to it ASAP.
3. Restart to find someone for repairing the heater next Monday.
4. I have enough money for the windows, i should contact someone after the heater got repairer.
5. For buying a car, no action now. Let's wait until next year.
6. I need to write a post for 401K + IRA issue. I think i haven't do IRA contribution this year and i need to do some operations for roth 401K.

### Growth

1. [Still] Better schedule the time in the afternoon, work goes first. ~Spend time in the morning for Leetcode, schedule the time during morning schedule~
2. [Still] Would use 23:00 ~ 24:00 for system design learning. ~Spend time in the morning for DDIA/CS books. Schedule it in the morning planning.~
3. [Still] I think it would help to practice some hobbies in the weekends. But I don’t have a plan now, pending this to return from China.
4. [Still] A Good Plan Today is Better than a Perfect Plan Tomorrow. Just read the news/novel. ~The Mint read takes 30 minutes, schedule the time in the morning (before lunch).~
5. [Resolved] ~To reduce the satiety, stand more!~

1. Follow the daily plan.
