2025 spring is an important time for me, I need to make careful schedule and stick to it.

> 凡事预则立，不预则废。

This doc presents a weekly day by day plan to ensure the time is not wasted. The retro should be conducted weekly.

## Retro

It's easy to lose momentum and grow laziness, I am one month behind than the schedule! I need to pick up the Leetcode practice and guarantee the progress of SD learning.

* Do the application every day, it would urge me to keep the trend
* Schedule the day upfront, otherwise it's truly easy to lose a lot of time
* Don't go to bed too late, otherwise the next day is totally wasted. Also I could have used the morning time for leetcode or other things
* Do a daily review every evening, so I can know how much work is done. Use an excel doc for daily work record

DO NOT WASTE TIME: if you waste one hour per day, you can just use that to play computer games.

## Detailed plan

I want to finish the preparation mentioned in 1point3acre one by one.

1. For coding, work on 3 new questions per day.
2. For SD, finish 6.824, then start hello interview
3. Arrange one hour on behavioral doc everyday
4. Arrange one hour on job application each day
5. Arrange one or two hours on work every day
6. Write a weekly retro

## Action item

1. Sleep before 1:55AM, otherwise the morning time will be wasted
2. 10:15 ~ 11:30 and 11:45 ~ 13:00 should be leetcode
3. It would be great if I can work 3 hours in the afternoon:
    * 1 hour for behavioral question
    * 2 hours for system design
4. Before 11:00, 3 hours purely for system design learning
5. After 12:00, have 2 hours work time
    * 1 hour for job application if necessary
