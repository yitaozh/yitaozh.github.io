### The problem

Many times I cannot finish reading a doc, or taking too long to read a doc. And by the end of the day I don't understand the doc and I need to read it again. Find a solution to this problem.

### How to do better next time

1. Allocate enough time to finish the paper in one iteration
1. Create a doc to record
    1. The notes
    1. The deep dive items for later
1. Keep progressing, don't get blocked
    1. Read the doc out and loud
