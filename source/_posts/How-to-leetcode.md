### The motivation

A good software developer doesn't necessarily need to be a good IOer, but in general a good IOer is more likely to be a good software developer. This logic makes coding more and more important in tech interview.

### The daily routine

Now I need to review first, review 3 days per day until I can catch the current date. Only do new exercise when I need to refresh the calendar of memoCard.

After that, do 2 days exercise per day. Until I can catch the current date.

After that, 2 new problems daily during workday(preferably in the morning). Then do the revision whenever possible.

### The environment

I am currently using leetcode website.
