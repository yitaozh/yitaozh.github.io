These are the main condition forms.

| Type          | Situation                 | Result                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| zero          | if + present              | present                           |
|               | if you hand in work late, | you make a bad impression         |
| first         | if + present              | will + infinitive                 |
|               | if we lose the contract,  | we'll be in trouble               |
| second        | if + past tense           | would + infinitive                |
|               | if we lost the contract,  | my job would be on the line.      |
| third         | if + past perfect         | would have + infinitive           |
|               | if we'd got the contract  | we would have made a lot of money |

### Zero conditionals

1. Use zero conditionals when the relationship between the situation and result is always true or always the same; there is no element of chance or doubt.

    If we *hit* our targets, we *get* a bonus.

2. We can also use two past tenses, to talk about something that always used to be true.

    We *got* time off in lieu if we *worked* weekends.

3. Informally, we can use this structure where a first conditional would be more appropriate in a formal situation.

    If we *lose* the contract, *we're* in trouble.

### First conditional

1. Use the first conditional when a situation is very likely to have the result given.

    If you *arrive* late, *you’ll miss* the first part of the meeting. ;

2. The present continuous and present perfect are possible in the if-clause.

    If *Jenny’s working* on this project, she'll learn a lot of useful stuff.
    If *Amit’s broken* his leg, you'll have to give the presentation.

3. Other modal expressions such as *can*, *may*, *be going to* are possible in the result clause.

    If we don’t gain market share, we *may* be in a sticky situation.
    *I'm going to* change distributors if Kikibo don't get their act together.

### Second conditional

1. Use the second conditional when a situation is hypothetical or imagined.

    If taxes rose, we *would consider* relocating.

2. The second conditional is also useful to make suggestions, offers, E
i warnings, etc. more distant and polite. i
: If you arrived at meetings on time, we’d get much more done. i
E 3 Might and could are also possible in the result clause. E
E We could save hundreds of hours if we adopted the new system.
- (_Mixed conditionals i
1 Itis possible to use the if-clause of a second conditional (if + ;
. past simple) with the result clause of a third conditional (would +
] perfect infinitive). This is an example of a mixed conditional. i
E If you cared more about your work, you would have been E
E promoted years ago. E
E Note that here we are talking about a general hypothetical E
. situation, with an imagined past result. E
i More often we use the if-clause of a third conditional (if + past
: perfect) with the result clause of a second conditional (would +
E present / continuous infinitive). E
i If I had got the job, I would earn €100,000 by now. (would + i
a a
i 1f 1 had got the job, I would be commuting for four hours a day. i
] (would + continuous infinitive) i
i Note that here we are imagining something that didn’t happen in i
E the past, with a present result. E

E Passive forms are possible in all types of conditional sentence, in E
. either clause. :
E If the contract is lost, we'll be in trouble. E
E If we adopted the new system, hundreds of hours could be saved.
