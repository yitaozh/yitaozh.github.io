### The problem

Many times I cannot finish reading a doc, or taking too long to read a doc. And by the end of the day I don't understand the doc and I need to read it again. Find a solution to this problem.

### How to do better next time

1. Allocate enough time to finish the paper in one iteration
1. Create a doc to record
    1. The notes
    1. The deep dive items for later
1. Keep progressing, don't get blocked
    1. Read the doc out and loud

### The three pass approach

1. The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper.

    * The title, abstract and introduction
    * Section and sub-section headings
    * Conclusion

2. The second pass lets you grasp the paperâ€™s content, but not its details.

    * You can ignore the details like proof in this pass
    * Pay special care at the figures, diagrams

3. The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.

    * Try to understand the details
