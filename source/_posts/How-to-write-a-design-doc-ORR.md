### The problem

It can take 2~3 weeks for me to finish one design doc/ORR. When there's a need to write such a doc, I would postphone the work as late as possible. And when there's no way to push it off, I wouldn't start the work until the last evening + morning. Such behaviour damages my mental health and also the doc quality.

### How to do better next time

* Setup the key stakeholder review day, internal review day early, so i can schedule work backwards
* Find some training from internal source, if thereâ€™s any, can use 1~2 days for this
* Find some example, can use half day for this
* Start to write, even just copying the example
* Start to lay out the architecture, so i can fill in each section later
