## Homework

These are the main condition forms.

| Type          | Situation                 | Result                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| zero          | if + present              | present                           |
|               | if you hand in work late, | you make a bad impression         |
| first         | if + present              | will + infinitive                 |
|               | if we lose the contract,  | we'll be in trouble               |
| second        | if + past tense           | would + infinitive                |
|               | if we lost the contract,  | my job would be on the line.      |
| third         | if + past perfect         | would have + infinitive           |
|               | if we'd got the contract  | we would have made a lot of money |

### Zero conditionals

1. Use zero conditionals when the relationship between the situation and result is always true or always the same; there is no element of chance or doubt.

    If we *hit* our targets, we *get* a bonus.

2. We can also use two past tenses, to talk about something that always used to be true.

    We *got* time off in lieu if we *worked* weekends.

3. Informally, we can use this structure where a first conditional would be more appropriate in a formal situation.

    If we *lose* the contract, *we're* in trouble.

### First conditional

1. Use the first conditional when a situation is very likely to have the result given.

    If you *arrive* late, *you’ll miss* the first part of the meeting. ;

2. The present continuous and present perfect are possible in the if-clause.

    If *Jenny’s working* on this project, she'll learn a lot of useful stuff.
    If *Amit’s broken* his leg, you'll have to give the presentation.

3. Other modal expressions such as *can*, *may*, *be going to* are possible in the result clause.

    If we don’t gain market share, we *may* be in a sticky situation.
    *I'm going to* change distributors if Kikibo don't get their act together.

### Second conditional

1. Use the second conditional when a situation is hypothetical or imagined.

    If taxes *rose*, we *would consider* relocating.

2. The second conditional is also useful to make suggestions, offers, warnings, etc. more distant and polite.

    If you arrived at meetings on time, *we’d* get much more done.

3. Might and could are also possible in the result clause.

    We *could* save hundreds of hours if we adopted the new system.

### Mixed conditionals

1. It is possible to use the *if-clause* of a second conditional (*if* + past simple) with the result clause of a third conditional (*would* + perfect infinitive). This is an example of a mixed conditional.

    > If you *cared* more about your work, you *would have been promoted* years ago.

    Note that here we are talking about a general hypothetical situation, with an imagined past result.

2. More often we use the *if-clause* of a third conditional (*if* + past perfect) with the result clause of a second conditional (*would* + present / continuous infinitive).

    > If I *had got* the job, I *would earn* €100,000 by now. (would + present infinitive)

    > If I *had got* the job, I *would be commuting* for four hours a day. (would + continuous infinitive)

Note that here we are imagining something that didn’t happen in the past, with a present result.

### Passives

* Passive forms are possible in all types of conditional sentence, in either clause.

    > If the contract *is lost*, we’ll be in trouble.

    > If we adopted the new system, hundreds of hours *could be saved*.

### Other words instead of *if*

1. In many conditional sentences, when can replace *if*. This makes a situation sound more likely. The same is true of every time.

    > *When* we hit our targets, we get a bonus.

    > *Every time* we hit our targets, we get a bonus.

2. In zero, first, and second conditionals, we can use unless to mean 'except if' or 'if not'.

    > *Unless* we keep our contract with Zimiercz, we'll be without a Polish partner company.

3. Participles such as *providing*, *provided*, *assuming*, and *supposing*, and phrases such as *on the condition that* and *as long as*, can also replace *if*.

    > *Providing* the building goes well, our new offices will be ready in May 2012.

    > *As long* as the pound stays strong, our projections will be realistic.

## Business Language Coaching - Session 5 - Choosing The Focus Word

* build on our work on pausing and intonation by diving more deeply into word stress

* be able to deliver presentations in a clear & dynamic way

### Starting Point

What were your takeaways from our last session on voice power? Have you had any opportunities to put any of the learning points into practice?

**Work in opposing teams. You are going to re-enact two dramatic presentations from the classic business movie Other People’s Money.**

The scene:

> Andrew Jorgenson is the patriarchal chairman of New England Wire and Cable. Once highly successful, his company has not kept up with new technology and both revenues and share price are down. Lawrence Garfield, known to his enemies as ‘Larry the Liquidator’, a corporate financier and one of the major stockholders, is trying to persuade the other stockholders at the annual general meeting to vote him in as the new chairman, so he can carry out his plan to sell off the company’s considerable assets before its share price falls any further. Of course, this will mean the closure of the firm and the loss of thousands of jobs.

**Work together annotating this famous movie scene using the points below. Then rehearse and read it aloud.**

TODO: listen to the audio and mark

The company is **dead**. | I **didn't** kill it. Don't blame **me**. | It was dead when I **got** here. | It's **too** late for prayers. For even if the prayers are **answered**, and a miracle **occurred**, and the yen did **this**, and the dollar did **that**, and the infrastructure did **the other** thing, we would still be **dead**. | You know **why**? Fiber **optics**. New **technologies**. **Obsolescence**. We're **dead** all right. We're just not **broke**. And you know the **surest** way to go broke? Keep getting an **increasing** share of a **shrinking** market. I'm not your **best** friend. I'm your **only** friend. I don't make **anything**? I'm making you **money**.
