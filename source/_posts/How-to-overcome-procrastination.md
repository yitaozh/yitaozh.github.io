### What

Procrastination is when we avoid a task we said we would do, for no good reason, despite expecting our behavior to bring negative consequences.

### Why

Many people procrastinate because they care too much.

Procrastinators often report a high fear of failure, putting things off because they're afarid their work won't live up to their high standards.

### Effect

Frequent procrastinators are likely to suffer from anxiety and depression, ongoing feelings of shame, higher stress levels and physical ailments associated with high stress.

### How

To short-circuit this stress response, we need to address and reduce these negative emotions.

1. breaking a task into smaller elements
2. journaling about why it's stressing you out
3. try removing nearby distractions that make it easy to impulsively procrastinate
4. forgiving yourself, and making a plan to do better next time
