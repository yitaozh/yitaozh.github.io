## Goal of this doc

People are not productive under anxiety. In daily life, people have concerns about different things: work, life, finance and so on. The goal of this doc:

1. Review the action items from last review and see how it goes.
2. Identify what’s concerning to me at the moment.
3. (Can I address them and) How to address them?
4. Get the Action Items from it.

The doc should be updated fortnightly. The Friday afternoon is a good time. Calendar already set up for this event.

When writing the new doc, all items from the old doc should be copied, the ones resolved can be marked as resoved or cross-lined, and they will be removed next time. New items should be added to the top lines of each section.

## My current concerns

### Work

#### Long term

1. My pay is not good, SDE of 2\~3 YOE should have 350\~400K salary

#### Short term

1. The acc-fwding project is running into problems
    - Hari is a good developer but a bad team leader, he's been giving bad instructions and diverting the RCA directiono. He vastly underestimated the effort to do dev-fleet testing.
    - Hari is blocking other people from work parallelly(the retry path CR).
1. I am not very productive during the morning and late afternoon, which means I need to work after-hour to meet up the goal and i cannot make up time for leetcode.
    - I can only get up at 9:15 or even 9:30, which means I need some business time for the morning shower and breakfast.
    - I am sleepy during after lunch in the afternoon.
1. I am working with a incompetent bad manager.
1. The Learnship training, i need to take $2070 out of pocket.

### Life

The life concerns are followed up in the [Things need to followup - Life](Things-need-to-followup-Life.md) doc

1. I didn't spend enough time with Awei.
1. The weekend time is not well spent.
1. The windows are blurred, i need to replace them.

### Growth

1. I want to work on Leetcode routinely. I want to study CS courses/books.
2. I want to grow hobbies: piano, guitar and so on
3. I didn’t follow the Mint Reads very well.

## How to mitigate the concerns

### Work

#### Long term

1. My I-140 get approved on 2022-11-02.
    - I should start the preparation right now.
      - Currently, reserve at least 1 hour for Leetcode every workday (in the work time) and weekends. Also read DDIA / system design books daily.

#### Short term

1. I should speak more for the acc-fwding project.
1. I need to learn from the  STJE failure.
1. 8:45 is a good get-up time.
    - I need 15 minutes for the morning shower
    - I need 15 minutes for the breakfast
    - I need 15 minutes for the morning planning
    - If WFH, I should get up at 8:45, as the latest time
    - If going to the office, I need another 5 (car) + (20) MBTA + (15) Bike = 40 minutes to go to the office, which means I can barely catch the standup, if getting up at 8:45.
1. I should prepare the bed in my study so i can take a short nap in the afternoon.
1. I should research on how to get the most of the in person training.

#### Action items for Work

- For acc fwding
  - I should record everyone's updates during update.
  - I should ask the question if anything is not going well for the project.
- Write a doc about learning from STJE failure.
- Have a planning section in the morning, depending on the meeting schedules:
  - Must finish items within the day (estimate during planning)
  - Mint reading (15 minutes) (if morning is occupied)
  - Leetcode (1 hour) (if morning is occupied)
  - DDIA (1 hour) (if morning is occupied)
- Clear the study and make the bed usable.
- Follow the schedule and start Leetcode + System design learning ASAP

### Life

1. Use weekend day time for learning and evening for entertainment.
1. After other things wrapped up, i should followup on the window issue, better get it replaced this Autumn.

#### Action items for Life

- Go out with Awei on Friday afternoon after getting the car.
- Go out with Awei on one day of the weekend(prefer Saturday).
- Use other weekend day time for learning and evening for entertainment.

### Growth

1. I think the time between 9:30 ~ 12:00 is pretty easy to slip, unless i have a dev fleet test to run.
1. I think it would help to practice some hobbies in the weekends.
    - After cleaning and rearrange the room, i should put the piano in the room and download the app to learn it.
    - I should have one guita, purchase one lately.
    - I should practice singing.
1. A Good Plan Today is Better than a Perfect Plan Tomorrow. Just read the news/novel. Arrange the time for it(in the morning).

#### Action items for Growth

- Plan the morning for all misc stuff like leetcode, DDIA, BaiCiZhan and Mint read.
- Only read the article for mint reading.
- No action item for piano and guita and singing now.
