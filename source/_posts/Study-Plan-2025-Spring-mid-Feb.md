2025 spring is an important time for me, I need to make careful schedule and stick to it.

> 凡事预则立，不预则废。

This doc presents a day by day plan to ensure the time is not wasted. The retro should be conducted biweekly.

## Retro

It's easy to lose momentum and grow laziness, I am one month behind than the schedule! I need to pick up the Leetcode practice and guarantee the progress of SD learning.

* Start the application next week(2/17), it would urge me to keep the trend
* Schedule the day upfront, otherwise it's truly easy to lose

## High level ideas

I want to finish the preparation mentioned in 1point3acre one by one.

1. For coding, work on 3 new questions per day.
2. For SD, one 6.824 lecture per day post catching up the Leetcode
3. Work on behavioral doc on this weekend(2/15)

LC: day time, preferably morning time
SD: daily after 10:30 to 1:30

**I am very behind for SD, never use night time for leetcode.**

## Detailed plan

### Coding

Work on the meta 3 months, around 100 left

### System design

1. 2/13 ~ 2/18 6 lectures of 6.824
2. 2/19 ~ 2/27 9 chapters of DDIA
3. 2/28 ~ 3/14 29 chapters of Alex's Xu
4. Starting from 3/14, newgpu + [System design interval](https://www.youtube.com/c/SystemDesignInterview)

### Behavioral question

go through the [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/112HBiMNvu6TYbDUOfVRe_MS4A-fKaWYrpMlmnsiMNiA/edit?tab=t.0) prior to submit applications(1/14)

## When should i start the mock and what's the frequency?

1. Start the coding mock right now
1. Start the SD mock on 3/14
