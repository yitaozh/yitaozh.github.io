2025 spring is an important time for me, I need to make careful schedule and stick to it.

> 凡事预则立，不预则废。

This doc presents a day by day plan to ensure the time is not wasted.

## High level ideas

I want to finish the preparation mentioned in 1point3acre one by one.

1. For coding, work on 6 new questions per day.
2. For SD, do 6.824, DDIA and Alex Xu in order
3. Work on behavioral doc during work hours

## The current schedule

1. 6 leetcode problems per day
2. One 6.824 lecture per day
3. No work on BQ now

LC: day time, preferably morning time
SD: daily after 10:30 to 2:00

## Detailed plan

### Coding

1. I should be able to finish the Neetcode 150 by ~~1/7~~ 1/8
2. After that, work on the meta 3 months, around 200 left

**When should i start the mock and what's the frequency?**

### System design

1. 1/2 ~ 1/10 9 lectures of 6.824
2. 1/13 ~ 1/16 4 lectures of 6.824
3. 1/17 ~ 1/25 9 chapters of DDIA
4. 1/26 ~ 2/9 29 chapters of Alex's Xu
5. Starting from 2/10, newgpu + [System design interval](https://www.youtube.com/c/SystemDesignInterview)

**When should i start the mock and what's the frequency?**

### Behavioral question

go through the [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/112HBiMNvu6TYbDUOfVRe_MS4A-fKaWYrpMlmnsiMNiA/edit?tab=t.0) prior to submit applications(1/14)

**When should i start the mock and what's the frequency?**

## The expected timeline

1. Start the coding mock after 1/7
1. Start the application on week 1/20, also start the BQ mock
1. Start the SD mock on 2/9
