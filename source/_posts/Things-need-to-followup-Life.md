## The things needs to followup

1. The [eclaimsline](https://www.eclaimsline.com/existing-claim), it's more than $1000, i should followup asap
2. The usbank escow amount should change, otherwise i am overcharged
3. The massSave for AC, it's $40 per AC, so $120 in total
4. Buy the accessories for auto from Temu
5. The overcharged dentist fee, i don't think i should be charged $600
6. The trip to Europe, i should contact one agent asap and arrange the trip
7. The amazon card points, it's wrongly calculated, $77.6 on 3/18
8. The xfinity fee has increased to $65/month, chat with an agent on that
