## Small talk notes

Only after all these steps **are we** convinced.
Only with these metrics **can you** measure.

## Business Language Coaching - Session 2 - Your Presentation

* Listen to and workshop your presentation
* Explore how pausing can help you communicate more successfully

### Starting point

Set the scene for your presentation. Tell me about:

#### The context & topic

* Sprint review
* Showcase progression on specific work

#### The audience and Your aims

* Give general information in a non-technical way

#### Concerns

* Did I give enough background information? Did I make it clear enough?
* Did I give the full story?

### Notes

#### Good

* signposting phrases
* rhetorical questions: "So maybe you would ask...?"
* grammatically flawless
* pronunciation good

#### To improve

* pausing
* pronunciation & intonation
* keywords: cost reduction, extent, AZ, delegate & destination, benefit
* explaining terminology
* repeating key words
* use analogies or examples
