## Goal of this doc

People are not productive under anxiety. In daily life, people have concerns about different things: work, life, finance and so on. The goal of this doc:

1. Identify what’s concerning to me at the moment
2. (Can I address them and) How to address them?
3. Get the Action Items from it

The doc should be updated at least once per month. The first Sunday night of each month is a good time.

## My current concerns

### Work:

#### Long term:

1. My pay is not good, SDE of 2\~3 YOE should have 350\~400K salary
2. My rating is not good, I got Meets in 2021 rating, how to get exceeds in 2022?

#### Short term:

1. I am not very productive during the day, no matter morning or afternoon, which means I need to work after-hour to meet up the goal.
    - For the morning, mostly it’s because I can only get up at 9:15 or even 9:30, which means I need some business time for the morning shower and breakfast.
    - In the afternoon, my at-home-office is too hot to concentrate. The sunshine could make the room boiling from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.
    - During business time, I got a lot of distraction from the reach outs: mostly from L4 new hires and L6 managers.
2. I have a terrible procrastination for doc writing tasks: I cannot finish a doc writing within 2 weeks.

### Life:

1. I didn’t get enough sleep. I need 6.5 \~ 7 hours of sleep every day, but I cannot get that much sleep every day.
2. I didn’t have the time to have all the entertainment every day. I want to:
    - Watch all the video updates
    - Watch all the Anime I am following
    - Have some time to play computer games every day/week
    - I cannot work on Arknights on time
3. I don’t know if we can go back to ShangHai this time. I have spent too much money and effort on this thing.

### Growth:

1. I want to work on Leetcode routinely. I want to study CS courses/books.
2. I want to grow hobbies: piano, guitar and so on
3. I didn’t follow the Mint Reads very well.
4. My weight loss project doesn’t go very well, I am sometimes full even in late night.

## How to mitigate the concerns

### Work

#### Long term:

1. I cannot do anything to my pay right now. Because even I get a new offer, I cannot afford the result that current employer doesn’t compete the offer: My PD day hasn’t been decided. My next steps are:
    - Upon PERM approval, I should ask Fragomen to file the I-140 as soon as possible and ask Srinivas@ to support the PP. I have bookmarked the template for a PP request.
    - Currently, the PERM processing time is 192 day, my PD is Jan 25, 2022. The expectation for the approval date is July 14, 2022. If my I-140 files + approves within 30 days, it would be August 15, 2022. I need to wait until at least Feb 15, 2022 to go to the new company. I should start the job seeking 45 days earlier: It’s Jan 1, 2022 right now.
    - I should start the preparation right now
        - Currently, reserve at least 1 hour for Leetcode every workday (in the work time) and weekends. Read DDIA / system design books daily.
        - 3 months before the job seeking time (it would be determined according to the I-140 approval time), I need to prepare for the interview intensively: 2 hours workday + 2 hours weekend. System design schedule is unchanged.
    - Under what scenarios would I pause/stop the plan?
        - The job seeking market becomes terrible, but I should continue the daily 1 hour Leetcode plan
        - Should I stop the plan if I got exceeds next year? No, that wouldn’t match my pay to the current level.
2. I should drive the execution of STJE, the productivity actually falls in the short-term solutions.

#### Short term:

1. 8:30 - 8:45 is a good get-up time.
    - I need 15 minutes for the morning shower
    - I need 15 minutes for the breakfast
    - I need 15 minutes for the morning planning
    - If WFH, I should get up at 8:45, as the latest time
    - If going to the office, I need another 5 (bike time) + (20) MBTA + (15) Shuttle = 40 minutes to go to the office, which means I can barely catch the standup, if getting up at 8:45.
2. I should replace the windows as soon as possible.
    - If Awei and I can return to China this time, then replace the windows soon
    - If we cannot make it this June, then replace it at the end of June
    - I should check with the property manager on:
        - Is it allowed to install an awning?
        - Is it allowed to install awning windows?
3. Before replacing the windows, I should check the temperature every day, and just go out to study in the afternoon, arrange it in the morning planning.
4. I should defer the reach-out if I am concentrating on something, make it a habit
5. How to finish doc writing tasks on time:
    - Break the tasks into smaller pieces
    - Setup a goal: what I must finish within today
    - Setup early reviews with folks: As soon as I take a doc writing task, setup a first review time as 1 week later, and with a few core stakeholder folks

### Life

1. I should go to sleep at 1:30 - 2:00, no later than that.
2. The time for entertainment:
    - I should try to spend time between 6\~7 for BaiCiZhan
    - Running time: about one hour, I can watch videos during this time, recommendation: 1.25 Asoul
    - After running, shower and construction time, I have 9:00 \~ 11:00 myself
    - Awei shower time: about 30 minutes, I can use it for Journal read, GongZhongHao
    - Weekends: I can have morning and evening for entertainment
3. For Arknights:
    - If there’s no event, should clear the request in the morning before business time and during evening entertainment time
    - If there’s one event ongoing, should check the tips asap and clear the maps
4. I have done everything for the ShangHai trip now, the only thing not done is the test appointments. Ideas:
    - 6.20 Ayass, no need for appointment
    - 6.25 RT for Awei, not sure if RT for Yitao, checking later
    - 6.26 Ayass for Awei and Yitao in the morning
    - 6.26 RT for Awei and Yitao in the afternoon

### Growth

1. Spend time in the morning for Leetcode, schedule the time during morning schedule
2. Spend time in the morning for DDIA/CS books. Schedule it in the morning planning.
3. I think it would help to practice some hobbies in the weekends. But I don’t have a plan now, pending this to return from China.
4. The Mint read takes 30 minutes, schedule the time in the morning (before lunch).
5. To reduce the satiety, stand more!

## Action items

1. Have a planning section in the morning, depending on the meeting schedules:
    - Mint reading (30 minutes)
    - Leetcode (1 hour)
    - DDIA (1 hour)
    - Must finish items within the day (estimate during planning)
    - Planning if I should go out
2. Should I save money for window replacement how?
    - I think I should, I should change the contribution rate to 0% now.
        - If in the end we cannot go back to China this time, I should have enough money for window replacement now.
        - If we can actually go to China this time, then set the money back to 46%, I don’t need USD in China
3. I should develop an apple watch app, which just tells me what to do at each time, which can be set by myself.
4. To make me feel better, I should finish the integration plan today (May 16), and use one hour per day to catch upon mint reading.
