### 3 Career Killers for Software Engineers

1. Not thinking clearly about staying or leaving

    - Considerations: 1. Manager 2. Pay
    - Sure, that hop could increase your compensation but you could be leaving a good team and moving to something worse.
    - If you're in a bad environment, don't believe promises but watch the management's actions to see if they're actually dealing with the root problem.
    - Ultimately, if you're in a good spot, don't throw it all away. You'll only recognize your golden ages from hindsight.


2. Preferring Output Over Impact

    - Finding task that differentiate yourself.
    - Finding a meaningful refactor that prevents future bugs is better than routinely integrating package updates.
    Great to have a nose for outsized impact.

3. Get Your Money Right

    Time in the market is better than timing in the market.
