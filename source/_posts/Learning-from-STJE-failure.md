This document would focus on what leads to the delay/failure of STJE launch.

## Timeline

- TBD

## Learning

- Think one step further: what should we do after the current work is done
- Think one level higher: what's the high level execution status of the project, how's the project going
- Due-deligence: I cannot just be driven by the manager, i need to check risks and progress myself.
- Always do the most important thing first: Some miscellaneous tasks can be tended to later, always work on the highest priority first
- Do the integration tests early: If the project contains changes to multiple components, plan the integTests and gamma testing as soon as possible.
