The 6 week alone time is a precious opportunity to catch up and learn.

> 凡事预则立，不预则废。

This doc presents a day by day plan to ensure the time is not wasted.

## High level ideas

What I want to achieve in the 6 weeks?

1. Catch up the leetcode schedule
1. Finish the MIT 6.824
1. Finish the chemtides website
1. Followup: [talent plan](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan)

## The current progress

* I have 2 contests to record
* I have 4 contests to work on

### The overall plan

1. Work on one contest per day, starting from Nov 19. Finish all the contest by this Friday
2. Review 2 days daily
3. Start working on MIT 6.824 from this Sunday

### Previous(Oct 19th)

* I have 3 more contest to review
* I can do one contest per day, with 6 reviews per day

#### The overall plan

1. Work on leetcode contests, then Meta questions
2. Work on MIT 6.824, one unit per day
    * Use the previous evening for the Preparation
    * Main work time: afternoon

### Previous

* Today is 9/19/2024
* The review is at 7/31, which means I have 50 days to review
* The recorded problem is at 8/11, which means I have 39 days to add new problem
* I think the maximum capacity is to review 6 days per day, which gives me 10 days to catch up.
* Then at the same time, do 6 new problems every day

#### The overall plan

**9/19 ~ 9/28(10 days):**

Weekday: 6 new problems + 6 days review
Weekend: 6 days review + work on previous contest

If there's spare time, work on the website implementation

**9/28 ~ 10/29(31 days):**

Work on MIT 6.824

* There are a total of 25 units: [schedule](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/schedule.html), which means no matter it's weekday or weekend, i should do one unit per day.
* The code implementation may take a lot of time, but we will see
