## The things needs to followup

1. The [eclaimsline](https://www.eclaimsline.com/existing-claim), it's more than $1000, i should followup asap
1. The massSave for AC, it's $40 per AC, so $120 in total
1. The CVS problem
    - The $10 discount got only used by $7.99, ask why
    - The reward cash are not being rewarded, ask why

## Do this today

1. Apply for the global debit card
1. The overcharged dentist fee, i don't think i should be charged $600
1. The amazon card points, it's wrongly calculated, $77.6 on 3/18
    - Sent a message 07/24/2023
    - Replied again on 07/31/2023
    - I got a response again but i don't like it, gonna respond again
1. The trip to Europe, i should contact one agent asap
    - ~~I am in touch with a sales in France, everything is going fine~~
    - ~~The deposit has been made~~

## Pending followup

1. The trip to Europe, i should arrange the trip
    - ~~Airbnb has been booked~~
    - ~~The air tickets have been booked~~
    - Pending on Visa approval
    - I should check if there's cheaper option for air tickets
    - I should book the tickets to museums and attractions

## Pending the right time

1. The trendmill, I should submit a request to refund in November
1. The garage key, i should bring it back to China to get an elegant copy

## Long term

1. Get a quota on how much is needed to replace the windows

## Resovled

1. The xfinity fee has increased to $65/month, chat with an agent on that
    - I have called on 08/04/2023, the billing reduced to $35/month
1. Buy the accessories for auto from Temu
    - The charcoal bags are bought 07/24/2023
    - Checked with Awei
    - Right noww no more item is needed, we will check what's needed later
1. The CVS annual membership, i think it's best to subscribe it around 10th of a month, in that case, there's no waste
    - Subscribed
1. The usbank escow amount should change, otherwise i am overcharged
    - Reached out on 07/24/2023
    - Replied again on 07/31/2023
    - The change has been made, but it will not be applied until october
    - I would receive a check at  that  time if i am overcharged
1. The Air ticket credit, is it expired?
    - I bought two AA tickets: New York to Dallas, total: $411.2
    - I canceled the above tickets, now there are $411.2 credit
    - The above credit is applied for BOS -> Dallas flight GXQQTY, total $475.20
    - GXQQTY got canceled(likely the electonic issue)
    - Purchased later tickets MNATQC, total $303.20, there are $86 left for each ticket
    - Well, since i am not going to book with AA this year, no need to follow this
