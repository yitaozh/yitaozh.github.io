## Goal of this doc

People are not productive under anxiety. In daily life, people have concerns about different things: work, life, finance and so on. The goal of this doc:

1. Review the action items from last review and see how it goes.
2. Identify what’s concerning to me at the moment.
3. (Can I address them and) How to address them?
4. Get the Action Items from it.

The doc should be updated fortnightly. The Friday afternoon is a good time. Calendar already set up for this event.

When writing the new doc, all items from the old doc should be copied, the ones resolved can be marked as resoved or cross-lined, and they will be removed next time. New items should be added to the top lines of each section.

## My current concerns

### Work

#### Long term

1. My pay is not good, SDE of 4\~5 YOE should have 450\~500K salary

### High level idea

1. I should change job as soon as possible. The plan B falls back, no meaning in waiting for submitting I-485 any more.

#### Action item

1. [Resolved] ~~My I-140 get approved on 2022-11-02.~~
    - I should start the preparation right now.
    - Stick to the leetcode and growth plan. ~~Currently, reserve at least 1 hour for Leetcode every workday (in the work time) and weekends. Also read DDIA / system design books daily.~~

#### Short term

1. I am not doing impactful projects.
    - Instead of working on new projects, I am working for launches, or dirty work, it's a waste of time and humiliation.
1. The team I am currently is drowning.
    - The EFS service is getting de-prioritized, so working in this team has no future.
1. [Resolved] The project launched successfully, for nothing. ~~The acc-fwding project is running into problems~~
    - ~~Hari is a good developer but a bad team leader, he's been giving bad instructions and diverting the RCA directiono. He vastly underestimated the effort to do dev-fleet testing.~~
    - ~~Hari is blocking other people from work parallelly(the retry path CR).~~
1. [Resolved] I will go to the office early in the morning, and 8:30 is early enough. ~~I am not very productive during the morning and late afternoon, which means I need to work after-hour to meet up the goal and i cannot make up time for leetcode.~~
    - ~~I can only get up at 9:15 or even 9:30, which means I need some business time for the morning shower and breakfast.~~
    - ~~I am sleepy during after lunch in the afternoon.~~
1. I am working with a incompetent bad manager.
1. [Resolved] I paid for the course, I will remember. ~~The Learnship training, i need to take $2070 out of pocket.~~

#### High level ideas

1. Considering I am going to leave Amazon, i don't care about project, manager or team any more.
1. [Resolved] ~~I should speak more for the acc-fwding project.~~
1. [Still] I need to learn from the  STJE failure.
1. [Resolved] ~~8:45 is a good get-up time.~~
    - ~~I need 15 minutes for the morning shower~~
    - ~~I need 15 minutes for the breakfast~~
    - ~~I need 15 minutes for the morning planning~~
    -~~ If WFH, I should get up at 8:45, as the latest time~~
    - ~~If going to the office, I need another 5 (car) + (20) MBTA + (15) Bike = 40 minutes to go to the office, which means I can barely catch the standup, if getting up at 8:45.~~
1. [Resolved] no more valid ~~I should prepare the bed in my study so i can take a short nap in the afternoon.~~
1. [Resolved] ~~I should research on how to get the most of the in person training.~~

#### Action items for Work

- [Resolved] ~~For acc fwding~~
  - ~~I should record everyone's updates during update.~~
  - ~~I should ask the question if anything is not going well for the project.~~
- Write a doc about learning from STJE failure.
- Have a planning section in the morning, depending on the meeting schedules:
  - If RTO, then have it right after the standup.
  - If at home, then have it right after the breakfast.
  - The focus is to finish the work before 1 PM, then leave the afternoon for growth(leetcode, course)
  - ~~Must finish items within the day (estimate during planning)~~
  - ~~Mint reading (15 minutes) (if morning is occupied)~~
  - ~~Leetcode (1 hour) (if morning is occupied)~~
  - ~~DDIA (1 hour) (if morning is occupied)~~
- Clear the study and make the bed usable.
- ~~Follow the schedule and start Leetcode + System design learning ASAP~~
