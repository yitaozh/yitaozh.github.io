### The motivation

A good software developer doesn't necessarily need to be a good IOer, but in general a good IOer is more likely to be a good software developer. This logic makes coding more and more important in tech interview.

### The daily routine

In general, at least two hours per workday should be dedicated to leecode practice. Current schedule is 11:00 ~ 13:00.

### The environment

I am currently using leetcode website.

### The order to solve problems

1. Go through [LABULADONG 的算法网站](https://labuladong.github.io/algo/) once first.

2. The [Explore](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/) is a great place next. Finish all courses.

3. Use the daily problem and study plan tool

### The steps to tackle one problem

If not idea at all, just check the comments. No need to wait for 5, 10 minutes

### Advance

Weekly contest, then codeforce
