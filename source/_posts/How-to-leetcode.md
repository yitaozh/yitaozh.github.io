### The motivation

A good software developer doesn't necessarily need to be a good IOer, but in general a good IOer is more likely to be a good software developer. This logic makes coding more and more important in tech interview.

### The daily routine

3 new problems daily during workday(preferably in the morning). Then do the revision whenever possible.

### The environment

I am currently using leetcode website.

### How to leetcode
