## Goal of this doc

People are not productive under anxiety. In daily life, people have concerns about different things: work, life, finance and so on. The goal of this doc:

1. Review the action items from last review and see how it goes.
2. Identify what’s concerning to me at the moment.
3. (Can I address them and) How to address them?
4. Get the Action Items from it.

The doc should be updated fortnightly. The Friday afternoon is a good time. Calendar already set up for this event.

When writing the new doc, all items from the old doc should be copied, the ones resolved can be marked as resoved or cross-lined, and they will be removed next time. New items should be added to the top lines of each section.

## My current concerns

### Work

#### Long term

1. My pay is not good, SDE of 2\~3 YOE should have 350\~400K salary
1. [Resolved] I don't care about the fucking rating anymore, it's bullshit. ~~My rating is not good, I got Meets in 2021 rating, how to get exceeds in 2022?~~

#### Short term

1. The acc-fwding project is running into problems
    - Hari is a good developer but a bad team leader, he's been giving bad instructions and diverting the RCA directiono. He vastly underestimated the effort to do dev-fleet testing.
    - Hari is blocking other people from work parallelly(the retry path CR).
1. I am not very productive during ~~the day, no matter morning or afternoon~~ the morning, which means I need to work after-hour to meet up the goal and i cannot make up time for leetcode.
    - I can only get up at 9:15 or even 9:30, which means I need some business time for the morning shower and breakfast.
    - [Resolved]The new AC resolved this problem. ~~In the afternoon, my at-home-office is too hot to concentrate. The sunshine could make the room boiling from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.~~
1. I am working with a incompetent bad manager. ~~I am going to have a new manager, either it's David or Ravi. David is micro management while i don't know about Ravi.~~
1. [Resolved] I don't need to write docs recently. ~~I have a terrible procrastination for doc writing tasks: I cannot finish a doc writing within 2 weeks.~~
1. [Resolved] The project has been paused. ~~The STJE project is running into all kinds of troubles and we are seeing more assertion/crashes than expected.~~

### Life

The life concerns are followed up in the [Things need to followup - Life](Things-need-to-followup-Life.md) doc

1. I didn't spend enough time with Awei.
1. The weekend time is not well spent.
1. [Resolved] ~~I didn’t have the time to have all the entertainment every day. I want to:~~
    - [Resolved] Good for now. ~~Watch all the video updates~~
    - [Resolved] Good for now. ~~Watch all the Anime I am following~~
    - [Resolved] Good for now. ~~Have some time to play computer games every day/week~~
    - [Resolved] Abandoned. ~~Play Arknights sometimes~~
1. [Resovled] Fixed. ~~The heater goes bad, i need to find someone to repair it.~~
1. The windows are blurred, i need to replace them.
1. [Resolved] Booked. ~~The car. I should buy a car so the life got much easier.~~
1. [Resolved] Checked. ~~The 401K, IRA problem.~~

### Growth

1. I want to work on Leetcode routinely. I want to study CS courses/books.
2. I want to grow hobbies: piano, guitar and so on
3. I didn’t follow the Mint Reads very well.
4. [Resolved] ~~My weight loss project doesn’t go very well, I am sometimes full even in late night.~~

## How to mitigate the concerns

### Work

#### Long term

1. My I-140 get approved on 2022-11-02.
    - I should start the preparation right now.
      - Currently, reserve at least 1 hour for Leetcode every workday (in the work time) and weekends. Also read DDIA / system design books daily.
    - [Resolved] I don't want to waste my time anymore to work with trash manager. ~~Under what scenarios would I pause/stop the plan?~~
      - ~~The job seeking market becomes terrible, but I should continue the daily Leetcode plan~~
      - ~~Should I stop the plan if I got exceeds next year? No, that wouldn’t match my pay to the current level.~~
2. [Resolved] The project is paused(permanently). ~~I should drive the execution of STJE, the productivity actually depends on the short-term solutions.~~

#### Short term

1. I should speak more for the acc-fwding project.
1. I need to learn from the  STJE failure.
1. 8:45 is a good get-up time.
    - I need 15 minutes for the morning shower
    - I need 15 minutes for the breakfast
    - I need 15 minutes for the morning planning
    - If WFH, I should get up at 8:45, as the latest time
    - If going to the office, I need another 5 (car) + (20) MBTA + (15) Bike = 40 minutes to go to the office, which means I can barely catch the standup, if getting up at 8:45.
1. [Resolved] It falls under the life category now. ~~I should replace the windows as soon as possible.~~
    - [Resolved] Not allowed and need a lot of money. ~~I should check with the property manager on:~~
        - [Resolved] ~~Is it allowed to install an awning?~~
        - [Resolved] ~~Is it allowed to install awning windows?~~
1. [Resolved] ~~How to finish doc writing tasks on time:~~
    - [Resolved] ~~Break the tasks into smaller pieces~~
    - [Resolved] ~~Setup a goal: what I must finish within today~~
    - [Resolved] ~~Setup early reviews with folks: As soon as I take a doc writing task, setup a first review time as 1 week later, and with a few core stakeholder folks~~
1. [Resolved] I am working with a trash manager. ~~For the new manager choice, let's wait until i get the new project.~~

#### Action items for Work

- For acc fwding
  - I should record everyone's updates during update.
  - I should ask the question if anything is not going well for the project.
- Write a doc about learning from STJE failure.
- Have a planning section in the morning, depending on the meeting schedules:
  - Must finish items within the day (estimate during planning)
  - Mint reading (15 minutes) (if morning is occupied)
  - Leetcode (1 hour) (if morning is occupied)
  - DDIA (1 hour) (if morning is occupied)
- Follow the schedule and start Leetcode + System design learning ASAP

### Life

1. Use weekend day time for learning and evening for entertainment.
1. After other things wrapped up, i should followup on the window issue, better get it replaced this Autumn.
1. [Resolved] ~~The time for entertainment:~~
    - [Resolved] ~~Weekends: I can have morning and evening for entertainment~~
1. [Resolved] ~~For Arknights:~~
    - [Resolved] ~~If there’s one event ongoing, should check the tips asap and clear the maps~~
1. [Resolved] I get the money from parents. ~~Should i save money to buy a car? If I plan to go back to china in May and back in August in 2023.~~

#### Action items for Life

- Go out with Awei on Friday afternoon after getting the car.
- Go out with Awei on one day of the weekend(prefer Saturday).
- Use other weekend day time for learning and evening for entertainment.

### Growth

1. I think the time between 9:30 ~ 12:00 is pretty easy to slip, unless i have a dev fleet test to run.
1. I think it would help to practice some hobbies in the weekends.
    - After cleaning and rearrange the room, i should put the piano in the room and download the app to learn it.
    - I should have one guita, purchase one lately.
    - I should practice singing.
1. A Good Plan Today is Better than a Perfect Plan Tomorrow. Just read the news/novel. Arrange the time for it(in the morning).

#### Action items for Growth

- Plan the morning for all misc stuff like leetcode, DDIA, BaiCiZhan and Mint read.
- Only read the article for mint reading.
